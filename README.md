#  Weather Application Using SwiftUI
## Compiling and Running Application
1. In the Constants.swift file, replace the APIKey with the actual API key from https://openweathermap.org/.
2. Also, please enable the Location Services from the System Preferences as this application uses core location to collect the current location information and then fetch the weather information based on it.

## User Interface
Application runs as the Popover in the status bar and displays the current temperature in the Farenheit. Clicking on it would open the popoer with the weather condition details and the forecast for the next five days.
